This is an evolution simulator that I wrote using Python with PyGame. It was programmed for a one month long Internet programming exposition, where entrants were instructed to create a simulated universe.

The creatures start out dumb, but as time passes, their neural net brains become smarter, since only the creatures who chase after food efficiently will survive and reproduce. In the end, we get creatures that are able to detect food and successfully navigate towards it, even though they were never specifically programmed to do so.

The source code uses Python's PyUnit for unit testing.

Here's a video of the simulator running:
